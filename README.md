# KickstarterProject

Kickstarter.com is a crowdfunding platform to help fundraisers attract money for projects. Projects are successful if they earn more money than a user-specified goal. If the project is successful, the fundraiser gets to keep all of the money raised; otherwise, they do not get any of the money.

I have used and evaluated different machine learning algorithms to predict if a project will get sponsored based on the features available. I have used Natural Language Processing techniques like DTM and TF-IDF on the textual data like reward descriptions. I have used the following models:
1) XGBoost
2) Boosting
3) Random Forest
4) Logistic Regression

I have performed feature engineering to select the best features from a set of 50 features and used techniques like Binning, Normalization, cross validation and have created the fitting curves.
